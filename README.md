## Process
### Commentary on Project Process
The project initially started as an exploration into voter turnout, but the authors shifted to the topic of police brutality because they wanted to tackle an issue more present in the news and understand the relationship that visualizations might have with such an issue. The authors were first focused on the few intense cases that had been the driving force of most police reform conversations throughout the past year, with the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Adam Toledo, and countless more. 

From these cases, the authors quickly realized that police brutality was a much more multidimensional issue than they had once perceived.
### Breakdown of Work
  All three authors contributed to the outlining of the narrative. Allan worked on the visualizations for legislation, militrization, and the calendar view, as well as some of their corresponding writing sections. Jodi worked on an accountabiltiy section (which we unfortunately could not fit at the end) as well as the missing data choropleth. She also contributed heavily to the formatting of the scrollytelling. Tanya worked on the marginalized community pie charts as well as the sepcific case studies accompanying many of the visualiations, with connections to the very current cases of Breonna Taylor and Adam Toledo. She also worke don the overall styling of the piece, with color and font selections.
