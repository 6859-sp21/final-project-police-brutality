                <p>
                  On March 29, 2021, Adam Toledo, a 13-year-old Latino boy,
                  was shot and killed by Chicago Police Department officer
                  Eric Stillman in the Little Village neighborhood on the
                  West Side of Chicago. A few hours after the shooting, the
                  CPD described the incident in a tweet as an "armed confrontation."

                <h2>Deaths By Police Brutality, Across the United States</h2>
                <p>
                  Each dot on the map underneath represents a fatal police shooting, from
                  the Washington Post's <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings">Fatal Force</a>

                  since January 1st, 2015. Adam Toledo is one of them.
                  <br><br>
                  It barely begins to capture the full picture of police brutality in the United States – for example, George Floyd, whose murder sparked
                  nationwide and global protests for the #BlackLivesMatter movement and against police brutality, isn't in this dataset because there was
                  no gun involved.
                  <br><br>
                  The people and stories above might be familiar to you – they've flashed across major news outlets along with countless others, to the point that
                  some, especially with the privilege to be detached, might be a little desensitized to the issues of police brutality. However, we need to better understand how serious of an issue this is
                  beyond the sheer number of people killed.

                <p>
                  Police brutality is a systemic issue with multiple facets, from racism to the militarization of our police to missing data for how serious the
                  problem actually is. If we look at police killings for the year 2021 thus far (data collected up to April 21, 2021), we find that there have only
                  been three days where there have beenn zero police killings.
                </p>
                <div id="d3-calendar" class="row-center"></div>
                <p>
                  Through examining the various layers of police brutality, we hope to deepen understanding surrounding this complex issue. We'll start
                  with an examination into how police brutality intersects with race and trickles down further into covering up deaths. We'll then examine the militariziation
                  of the police as well as stagnated avenues to change, and close with highlighing the significance of missing data.

                <p>
                  On May 15, 2021, the NYTimes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/15/us/african-americans-sickle-cell-police.html?campaign_id=9&emc=edit_nn_20210516&instance_id=30943&nl=the-morning&regi_id=81947204&segment_id=58211&te=1&user_id=95d7a0886d09bc2efc9c0403062e96ed">revealed a detailed examination</a> of autopsy records, court filings, and police reports – bringing

                  the possession of one of the two genes necessary for sickle cell disease, affects millions
                  of people throughout the world but is more common among Black people. The condition is almost always benign on its own,
                  but American pathologists have used the condition to rule the in-custody deaths of Black people as accidents or natural occurrences.

                    Adam Toledo was killed in Little Village, a predominantly Mexican community on Chicago's West Side. Many neighborhood residents
                    put in effort to argue that his death didn't matter because he had a gun – <a href="https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/police-and-prosecutors/2021/adam-toledo-little-village-police-gangs/">they raised concerns that the thirteen year-old was a gang member</a>, and some
                    even vilified Adam and his family. While it's unclear if he was a member, the mere assumption of him being one flattens his death to a consequence from 
                    being with the wrong crowd, rather than a tragedy that reflects disinvestment from communities, housing and racial discrimination, and efforts to curb gun violence.

                <h2>The Militarization of Police</h2>
                <p>
                  In the early 1990s, Congress authorized the Department of Defense to transfer excess military equipment to
                  law enforcement agencies across the United States. In 1997, this program was made permanent under section 1033 of the
                  National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and henceforth referred to as the "1033 program" in reporting. The kinds of equipment
                  made available to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) under the program vary, from relatively benign, uncontrolled items, such as raincoats and office equipment,
                  to rifles and armored vehicles, which are categorized as controlled equipment. Even today, the majority of the items distributed are in the former category, and represent an efficient
                  way to avoid wasting taxpayer funds. However, even though controlled items loaned are far fewer in number, their values, and the ensuing savings
                  afforded to LEAs, dominate the total value of equipment distributed.
                </p>
                <h4>Cumulative Value of 1033 Program Equipment Over Time, Organized by DoD DEMIL Code</h4>
                <div id="d3-militarization"></div>
                <p>
                  This stacked area plot makes use of data from the Massachusetts ACLU, which tracked all of the equipment provided to LEAs since the early 1990s. Tracked along with the
                  dollar value of items, and the agencies to which they are provided, are DoD "DEMIL Codes", which guide policies for demilitarizing different types of
                  military equipment when they leave DoD control. They can be used to roughly distinguish between the categories of equipment given to LEAs through the 1033 program.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>A : Mostly benign, uncontrolled materials, which "present a low risk when released out of DoD control.</p></li>
                  <li><p>B and Q: Require "mutilation to the point of scrap" either worldwide, or when disposed of outside of the United States. Inlcludes items like night vision goggles, some electronic equiipment,
                    and certain vehicles.</p></li>
                  <li><p>D : Includes most firearms, which require destruction beyond the opint of repair and reuse.</p></li>
                  <li><p>C : Require removal and destruction only of certain key components. Includes most vehicles, from helicopters to trucks, to the Armored Personnel Carriers popular with SWAT teams and riot police.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Notably, after the end of large scale deployments in Iraq around 2010, the value and number of items with DEMIL code "C" rose massively. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is important to note that not all of the armored vehicles used by police in the United States are acquired through this program. In fact, many of the largest
                  police departments are sufficiently well funded to afford purchasing these items outright. However, this data demonstrates that amid growing outrage against
                  police tactics and violence, many LEAs, across the country are only becoming better armed and equipped.

                      Louisville police officers used a battering ram to enter Breonna Taylor's apartment at around midnight on March 13, investigating whether the apartment was being used to receive packages for a drug selling operation. 
                      Breonna Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, feared that her ex-boyfriend was trying to break in and fired a gun once after the police broke the door off its hinges. The police responded by firing back, and their 
                      shots struck Breonna five times. While she received no medical attention, the officers at the scene called an ambulance to the scene and aided their shot colleague.

                      Vehicles and tactics used to fight the "War on Terror" are now being deployed in response to domestic protests and used to execute these kinds of no-knock warrants. Breonna Taylor was killed during a drug

                <h2>Missing Data</h2>
                <p>
                  A significant challenge facing the push for police reform is the lack of complete data on
                  policing in the United States. The FBI collects and publishes detailed crime statistics, but data on
                  police practices and conduct are relatively sparse and disjoint. Recently, amid the push for police reform,
                  the FBI announced the creation of a national use of force database, and called for individual law enforcement
                  organizations to participate. As of late 2019, 40% of agencies had enrolled in the program, triggering
                  the release of the inital participation data displayed in the map below. The FBI will not begin
                  releasing the actual use of force data until they reach 80% participation. Increased participation in the national
                  use of force registry would make studying policing much easier, and enable better accountability for law enforcement
                  agencies across the country.
