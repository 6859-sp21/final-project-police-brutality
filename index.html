                    On March 29, 2021, Adam Toledo, a 13-year-old Latino boy,
                    was shot and killed by Chicago Police Department officer
                    Eric Stillman in the Little Village neighborhood on the
                    West Side of Chicago. A few hours after the shooting, the
                    CPD described the incident in a tweet as an "armed confrontation."

                    was fatally shot by police officer Kimberly Potter during a traffic
                    stop and attempted arrest for an outstanding arrest warrant in Brooklyn
                    Center, Minnesota. After a brief struggle with officers, Wright was shot at close range.

                <h3>Police Deaths Across the United States</h3>
                <p>Each dot on the map underneath represents a fatal police shooting, from
                  the Washington Post's <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings">Fatal Force</a>
                  dataset, containing records of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty
                  since January 1st, 2015.
                  <br>
                  It barely begins to capture the full picture of police brutality in the United States – for example, George Floyd, whose murder sparked
                  nationwide and global protests for the #BlackLivesMatter movement and against police brutality, isn't in this dataset because there was
                  no gun involved.
                  <br>
                  The people and stories above might be familiar to you – they've flashed across major news outlets along with countless others, to the point that
                  we might all be a little desensitized to the issues of police brutality. However, we need to better understand how serious of an issue this is
                  beyond the sheer number of people killed.

                <h3>Data Incompleteness</h3>
                <p> A significant challenge facing the push for police reform is the lack of complete data on
                policing in the United States. The FBI collects and publishes detailed crime statistics, but data on
                police practices and conduct are relatively sparse and disjoint. Recently, amid the push for police reform,
                the FBI announced the creation of a national use of force database, and called for individual law enforcement
                organizations to participate. As of late 2019, 40% of agencies had enrolled in the program, triggering
                the release of the inital participation data displayed in the map below. The FBI will not begin
                releasing the actual use of force data until they reach 80% participation. Increased participation in the national
                use of force registry would make studying policing much easier, and enable better accountability for law enforcement
                agencies across the country.</p>
