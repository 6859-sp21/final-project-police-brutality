                <p>On March 29, 2021, Adam Toledo, a 13-year-old Latino boy,
                  was shot and killed by Chicago Police Department officer
                  Eric Stillman in the Little Village neighborhood on the
                  West Side of Chicago. A few hours after the shooting, the
                  CPD described the incident in a tweet as an "armed confrontation."

                <h2>Deaths By Police Brutality, Across the United States</h2>
                <p>Each dot on the map underneath represents a fatal police shooting, from
                  the Washington Post's <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings">Fatal Force</a>
                  dataset, containing records of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty
                  since January 1st, 2015.
                  <br><br>
                  It barely begins to capture the full picture of police brutality in the United States – for example, George Floyd, whose murder sparked
                  nationwide and global protests for the #BlackLivesMatter movement and against police brutality, isn't in this dataset because there was
                  no gun involved.
                  <br><br>
                  The people and stories above might be familiar to you – they've flashed across major news outlets along with countless others, to the point that
                  some, especially with the privilege to be detached, might be a little desensitized to the issues of police brutality. However, we need to better understand how serious of an issue this is
                  beyond the sheer number of people killed.

            <section id="why">
              <h2>How has police brutality persisted as an issue?</h2>
              <p> Police brutality is a systemic issue with multiple facets, from racism to the militarization of our police to missing data for how serious the
                problem actually is. If we look at police killings for the year 2021 thus far, we find that there have only
                been six days where there have beenn zero police killings.</p>
              <div id="d3-calendar"></div>
              <p>Through examining the various layers of police brutality, we hope to deepen understanding surrounding this complex issue. We'll start
                with an examination into how police brutality intersects with race and trickles down further into covering up deaths. We'll then examine the militariziation
                of the police as well as stagnated avenues to change, and close with highlighing the significance of missing data.

                  <p>From the growth of each sector, we find significant shifts particularly with Black deaths – while Black people constitute
                    approximately 13.4% of the overall population, they make up 28% of deaths by police brutality, from Mapping Police Violence's <a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/aboutthedata">data collected from 2013 to present day</a>.

              <h3>The Insidious Extension of Race</h3>
              <p>Like one in 13 Black Americans, Lamont Perry was born with sickle cell trait, and he died while fleeing the police through
              the woods of Wadesboro, North Carolina. The state medical examiner attributed his death to sickle cell trait, concluding that
              he had died by accident.</p>
              <p>
              On May 15, 2021, the NYTimes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/15/us/african-americans-sickle-cell-police.html?campaign_id=9&emc=edit_nn_20210516&instance_id=30943&nl=the-morning&regi_id=81947204&segment_id=58211&te=1&user_id=95d7a0886d09bc2efc9c0403062e96ed">revealed a detailed examination</a> of autopsy records, court filings, and police reports – bringing
              to light how many Black people in custody whose deaths were labeled as undetermined, accidental, or natural. Sickle cell trait,
              the possession of one of the two genes necessary for sickle cell disease, affects millions
              of people throughout the world but is more common among Black people. The condition is almost always benign on its own,
              but American pathologists have used the condition to rule the in-custody deaths of Black people as accidents or natural occurrences.

              <h3>The militarization of police</h3>


              <p>In the early 1990s, Congress authorized the Department of Defense to transfer excess military equipment to
              law enforcement agencies across the United States. In 1997, this program was made permanent under section 1033 of the
              National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and henceforth referred to as the "1033 program" in reporting. The kinds of equipment
              made available to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) under the program vary, from relatively benign, uncontrolled items, such as raincoats and office equipment,
              to rifles and armored vehicles, which are categorized as controlled equipment. Even today, the majority of the items distributed are in the former category, and represent an efficient
              way to avoid wasting taxpayer funds. However, even though controlled items loaned are far fewer in number, their values, and the ensuing savings
              afforded to LEAs, dominate the total value of equipment distributed.
            </p>
            <h4>Cumulative Value of 1033 Program Equipment Over Time, Organized by DoD DEMIL Code</h4>
            <div id="d3-militarization"></div>
            <p>
              This stacked area plot makes use of data from the Massachusetts ACLU, which tracked all of the equipment provided to LEAs since the early 1990s. Tracked along with the
              dollar value of items, and the agencies to which they are provided, are DoD "DEMIL Codes", which guide policies for demilitarizing different types of
              military equipment when they leave DoD control. They can be used to roughly distinguish between the categories of equipment given to LEAs through the 1033 program.
              Equipment with DEMIL Code "A" are mostly benign, uncontrolled materials, which "present a low risk when released out of DoD control." "B" and "Q" items require "mutilation
              to the point of scrap" either worldwide, or when disposed of outside of the United States, and include items such as night vision goggles, some electronic equipment, and
              certain vehicles. "D" includes most firearms, which require destruction beyond the point of repair and reuse. Finally, items labeled with DEMIL code "C" require the
              removal and destruction only of certain key components. This category includes most vehicles, from helicopters, to trucks, to the Armored Personnel Carriers popular with SWAT
              teams and riot police.
            </p>
            <p>
              Notably, after the end of large scale deployments in Iraq around 2010, the value and number of items with DEMIL code "C" rose massively. Vehicles used to
              fight the "War on Terror" are now being deployed in response to domestic protests and used to execute the kinds of no-knock warrants made infamous by the killing of Breonna Taylor.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important to note that not all of the armored vehicles used by police in the United States are acquired through this program. In fact, many of the largest
              police departments are sufficiently well funded to afford purchasing these items outright. However, this data demonstrates that amid growing outrage against
              police tactics and violence, many LEAs, across the country are only becoming better armed and equipped.

                <h2>Missing Data</h2>
                <p> A significant challenge facing the push for police reform is the lack of complete data on
                policing in the United States. The FBI collects and publishes detailed crime statistics, but data on
                police practices and conduct are relatively sparse and disjoint. Recently, amid the push for police reform,
                the FBI announced the creation of a national use of force database, and called for individual law enforcement
                organizations to participate. As of late 2019, 40% of agencies had enrolled in the program, triggering
                the release of the inital participation data displayed in the map below. The FBI will not begin
                releasing the actual use of force data until they reach 80% participation. Increased participation in the national
                use of force registry would make studying policing much easier, and enable better accountability for law enforcement
                agencies across the country.</p>
