                    On April 11, 2021, Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old African-American man,
                    was fatally shot by police officer Kimberly Potter during a traffic
                    stop and attempted arrest for an outstanding arrest warrant in Brooklyn
                    Center, Minnesota. After a brief struggle with officers, Wright was shot at close range.

                <h3>Police Deaths Across the United States</h3>
                <p>Each dot on the map underneath represents a fatal police shooting, from
                  the Washington Post's <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings">Fatal Force</a>
                  dataset, containing records of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty
                  since January 1st, 2015.
                  <br><br>
                  It barely begins to capture the full picture of police brutality in the United States – for example, George Floyd, whose murder sparked
                  nationwide and global protests for the #BlackLivesMatter movement and against police brutality, isn't in this dataset because there was
                  no gun involved.
                  <br><br>
                  The people and stories above might be familiar to you – they've flashed across major news outlets along with countless others, to the point that
                  we might all be a little desensitized to the issues of police brutality. However, we need to better understand how serious of an issue this is
                  beyond the sheer number of people killed.

                    We need to also consider the relative population within the United States.

                  <p>It might make a little more sense that White Americans constitute more of the data, because there are significantly more
                    White Americans in the United States. However, Black and brown communities are disproportionately more affected by police brutality, collectively
                    making up x% of police brutality deaths while only comprising y% of the total population.

              Like one in 13 Black Americans, Lamont Perry was born with sickle cell trait, and he died while fleeing the police through
              the woods of Wadesboro, North Carolina. The state medical examiner attributed his death to sickle cell trait, concluding that
              he had died bby accident.
              <br>
              On May 15, 2021, the NYTimes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/15/us/african-americans-sickle-cell-police.html?campaign_id=9&emc=edit_nn_20210516&instance_id=30943&nl=the-morning&regi_id=81947204&segment_id=58211&te=1&user_id=95d7a0886d09bc2efc9c0403062e96ed">revealed a detailed examination</a> of autopsy records, court filings, and police reports – bringing 
              to light how many Black people in custody whose deaths were labeled as undetermined, accidental, or natural. Sickle cell trait, 
              the possession of one of the two genes necessary for sickle cell disease, affects millions 
              of people throughout the world but is more common among Black people. The condition is almost always benign on its own, 
              but American pathologists have used the condition to rule the in-custody deaths of Black people as accidents or natural occurrences.

                <h3>Data Incompleteness</h3>
                <p> A significant challenge facing the push for police reform is the lack of complete data on
                policing in the United States. The FBI collects and publishes detailed crime statistics, but data on
                police practices and conduct are relatively sparse and disjoint. Recently, amid the push for police reform,
                the FBI announced the creation of a national use of force database, and called for individual law enforcement
                organizations to participate. As of late 2019, 40% of agencies had enrolled in the program, triggering
                the release of the inital participation data displayed in the map below. The FBI will not begin
                releasing the actual use of force data until they reach 80% participation. Increased participation in the national
                use of force registry would make studying policing much easier, and enable better accountability for law enforcement
                agencies across the country.</p>
