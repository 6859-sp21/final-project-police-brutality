                    On March 29, 2021, Adam Toledo, a 13-year-old Latino boy, 
                    was shot and killed by Chicago Police Department officer 
                    Eric Stillman in the Little Village neighborhood on the 
                    West Side of Chicago. A few hours after the shooting, the
                    CPD described the incident in a tweet as an "armed confrontation."

                    stop and attempted arrest for an outstanding arrest warrant in Brooklyn
                    Center, Minnesota. After a brief struggle with officers, Wright was shot at close range.

                <h3>Police Deaths Across the United States</h3>
                <p>Each dot on the map underneath represents a fatal police shooting, from
                  the Washington Post's <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings">Fatal Force</a>
                  dataset, containing records of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty
                  since January 1st, 2015.
                  <br>
                  It barely begins to capture the full picture of police brutality in the United States – for example, George Floyd, whose murder sparked 
                  nationwide and global protests for the #BlackLivesMatter movement and against police brutality, isn't in this dataset because there was
                  no gun involved. 
                  <br>
                  The people and stories above might be familiar to you – they've flashed across major news outlets along with countless others, to the point that
                  we might all be a little desensitized to the issues of police brutality. However, we need to better understand how serious of an issue this is 
                  beyond the sheer number of people killed.
